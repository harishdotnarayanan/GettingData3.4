CODEBOOK - Week 4 Assignment

VARIABLES:

1. activity: Indicates the type of activity that was performed by the subjects when values were collected. 

There are 6 different types of activities being tracked:
	WALKING
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	SITTING
	STANDING
	LAYING	

2. subject: The subject that was performing the activity.
	1 .. 30 (30 different subjects)

3. feature: the name of the feature or measurement obtained from the accelerometer and gyroscope. This combines with axis and mean/std to give the appropriate value in that axis. 
The possible values are:
	frequencyOfBodyAcceleration
	frequencyOfBodyAccelerationJerk
	frequencyOfBodyAccelerationMag
	frequencyOfBodyBodyAccelerationJerkMag
	frequencyOfBodyBodyGyroJerkMag
	frequencyOfBodyBodyGyroMag
	frequencyOfBodyGyro
	timeOfBodyAcceleration
	timeOfBodyAccelerationJerk
	timeOfBodyAccelerationJerkMag
	timeOfBodyAccelerationMag
	timeOfBodyGyro
	timeOfBodyGyroJerk
	timeOfBodyGyroJerkMag
	timeOfBodyGyroMag
	timeOfGravityAcceleration
	timeOfGravityAccelerationMag

4. axis: Denotes which of the 3 axis (X or Y or Z) the signal was measured on. If axis is not relevant to the feature/measurement, “None” is entered.
The possible values are:
	X
	Y
	Z
	None

5. averageOfMean: This is the average of the normalized values of the means of the corresponding “feature/measurement” on the “axis”, for the “subject” while performing the “activity”. This is bounded between [-1,1]

6. averageOfStd: This is the average of the normalized values of the standard deviations of the corresponding “feature/measurement” on the “axis”, for the “subject” while performing the “activity”. This is bounded between [-1,1]
