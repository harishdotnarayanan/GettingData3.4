# CODEBOOK - Week 4 Assignment

## VARIABLES:

### 1. activity: Indicates the type of activity that was performed by the subjects when values were collected. 

There are 6 different types of activities being tracked:
	WALKING
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	SITTING
	STANDING
	LAYING	

### 2. subject: The subject that was performing the activity.
	1 .. 30 (30 different subjects)

(Columns 3 to 6 below follow the principles of Tidy Data as follows: each column represents a variable (such as 
feature, axis, mean and std.) Each feature is a variable that is recorded on 3 dimensions. Each of these dimensions 
are treated as variables as well. Mean and Std are available for all features and hence can be treated as variables.)

### 3. feature: the name of the feature or measurement obtained from the accelerometer and gyroscope. This combines 
with axis and mean/std to give the appropriate value in that axis. All values with the word “Jerk” imply that there 
is Jerk associated with the feature when the reading was taken. Values with “Mag” imply the magnitude of the 3-dimensional 
signals.
The possible values are:
	frequencyOfBodyAcceleration
	frequencyOfBodyAccelerationJerk
	frequencyOfBodyAccelerationMag
	frequencyOfBodyBodyAccelerationJerkMag
	frequencyOfBodyBodyGyroJerkMag
	frequencyOfBodyBodyGyroMag
	frequencyOfBodyGyro
	timeOfBodyAcceleration
	timeOfBodyAccelerationJerk
	timeOfBodyAccelerationJerkMag
	timeOfBodyAccelerationMag
	timeOfBodyGyro
	timeOfBodyGyroJerk
	timeOfBodyGyroJerkMag
	timeOfBodyGyroMag
	timeOfGravityAcceleration
	timeOfGravityAccelerationMag

### 4. axis: Denotes which of the 3 axis (X or Y or Z) the signal was measured on. If axis is not relevant to the 
feature/measurement, “None” is entered.
The possible values are:
	X
	Y
	Z
	None

### 5. averageOfMean: This is the average of the normalized values of the means of the corresponding 
“feature/measurement” on the “axis”, for the “subject” while performing the “activity”. 
This is bounded between [-1,1]

### 6. averageOfStd: This is the average of the normalized values of the standard deviations of the 
corresponding “feature/measurement” on the “axis”, for the “subject” while performing the “activity”. 
This is bounded between [-1,1]
